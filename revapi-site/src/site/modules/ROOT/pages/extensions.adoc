= Extensions

Revapi has been written with extensibility in mind. Everything from API scanning, filtering to report generation is
extensible. Revapi comes with a couple of extensions that make it useful without a need to write any code yourself
(even though writing an extension is super simple and fun ;) ).

Revapi comes with a couple of extensions that are bundled by default with the maven plugin, ant task and the CLI.
These include the extensions contained in the xref:revapi-basic-features::index.adoc[Revapi Basic Features] and
of course the xref:revapi-java::index.adoc[Revapi Java] extension.

There are also some 3rd party extensions, for example https://github.com/jenkinsci/lib-revapi-hpi-extractor that
the Jenkins CI uses to make Revapi understand the HPI packaging of the Jenkins plugins or
https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-revapi-extension used for analyzing Mule modules.
