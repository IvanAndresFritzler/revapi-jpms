== Getting Started

Revapi can be used in 4 ways. Either as a standalone java program, using its maven plugin or ant task during build or as
an embedded library.

=== Maven

NOTE: You can read more about the maven plugin in its link:modules/revapi-maven-plugin/index.html[dedicated section].

NOTE: You can find the latest versions of the various Revapi components in the link:downloads.html[downloads section].

Revapi's main purpose is to track API changes between releases. This is ideally done during build and so the maven
integration is essential.

The basic usage of the Revapi's maven plugin is quite simple. In your `pom.xml`, do:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    ...
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
            <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>{version}</version>
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
                    <artifactId>revapi-java</artifactId>
                    <version>{version}</version>
                </dependency>
                ...
            </dependencies>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>check</id>
                    <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
    ...
</build>
----

By default, Revapi only bundles the link:modules/revapi-basic-features/index.html[basic features] so in order to
check your java code, you need to add the Revapi's java extension as a dependency to the maven plugin.

For more detailed info, check the maven plugin's link:modules/revapi-maven-plugin/index.html[site].

=== Gradle

There is an externally developed Gradle plugin contributed by https://palantir.com[Palantir],
the https://github.com/palantir/gradle-revapi[gradle-revapi] plugin. Please consult
the https://github.com/palantir/gradle-revapi[home page] of the project for usage guidelines and documentation.

=== Standalone Usage

NOTE: More information about the Revapi's CLI tool, can be obtained from its
link:modules/revapi-standalone/index.html[dedicated section].

First you need to download the standalone distribution of Revapi, say `revapi-standalone-{version}.zip`.
Now you have to:

----
unzip revapi-standalone-{version}.zip
cd revapi-standalone-{version}
----

Your installation is now ready. To start using it, you can simply invoke

----
./revapi.sh
----

(or if you're unfortunate enough to be on windows)

----
revapi.bat
----

and you will be presented with the usual usage information.

An invocation of Revapi could look like this:

----
./revapi.sh --extensions=org.revapi:revapi-java:{version},org.revapi:revapi-reporting-text:{version} \
   --old=my-lib-0.1.0.jar --new=my-lib-0.2.0.jar -D revapi.reporter.text.minSeverity=BREAKING
----

Different extensions might define different configuration options that you might supply to them using either the `-D`
command line parameter or they can be read from configuration file(s) specified by the `-c` option.

=== Ant

NOTE: You can read more about the Revapi's Ant task in its link:modules/revapi-ant-task/index.html[dedicated section].

There is also an Ant task to invoke Revapi analysis on arbitrary archives.
The task implicitly supports the link:modules/revapi-basic-features/index.html[basic features] but other extensions
need to be added.

The following attributes are supported:

|====
|`oldArchives`|The `FileSet` of archives of the old version of the API
|`oldSupplementaryArchives`|The `FileSet` of archives that support the old API (i.e. dependencies)
|`newArchives`|The `FileSet` of archives of the new version of the API
|`newSupplementaryArchives`|The `FileSet` of archives that support the new API (i.e. dependencies)
|`revapiClassPath`|A `Path` to additional extensions to use with Revapi
|`configuration`|A JSON string with the Revapi configuration
|`breakingSeverity`|The minimal severity of differences that will be reported
|====

An example for checking Java code:

[source,xml]
----
<target name="api-check">
  <taskdef name="revapi" classname="org.revapi.ant.RevapiTask" classpath="lib/revapi-ant-task-{version}.jar"/>
  <revapi>
    <oldArchives file="mylib-1.0.jar"/>
    <newArchives file="mylib-1.1.jar"/>
    <revapiClassPath>
      <pathelement location="lib/revapi-java-{version}-uber.jar"/>
    </revapiClassPath>
  </revapi>
</target>
----

Notice the use of the "uber" jar for the java extension. The uber jar of
the java extension contains its dependencies (excluding the revapi API
itself which is considered provided).

=== Embedding

[source,java]
----
Revapi revapi = Revapi.builder().withAllExtensionsFromThreadContextClassLoader().build();

AnalysisContext analysisContext = AnalysisContext.builder()
    .withOldAPI(API.of(...))
    .withNewAPI(API.of(...))
    .withConfigurationFromJSON("json").build();

revapi.analyze(analysisContext);
