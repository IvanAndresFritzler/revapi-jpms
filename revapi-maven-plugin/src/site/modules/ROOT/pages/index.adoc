= Revapi Maven Plugin

Revapi Maven plugin enables API checks during the Maven build. By default, it checks the currently built project against
the its latest released version (as reported by Maven). Alternatively, the two artifacts to can be set arbitrarily.

The plugin offers the following Maven goals:

* link:{attachmentsdir}/check-mojo.html[revapi:check] is used as part of the build to ensure a configurable level of compatibility.
* link:{attachmentsdir}/report-mojo.html[revapi:report] generates a simple report for the project's maven-generated site.
* link:{attachmentsdir}/report-aggregate-mojo.html[revapi:report-aggregate] runs a report on all projects in a reactor using a
configuration supplied at the top-level aggregator project.
* link:{attachmentsdir}/validate-configuration-mojo.html[revapi:validate-configuration] validates the configuration of Revapi (use
this to debug problems with the configuration).
* link:{attachmentsdir}/update-versions-mojo.html[revapi:update-versions] updates the version string in pom.xml according to
http://semver.org[semver] rules.
* link:{attachmentsdir}/update-release-properties-mojo.html[revapi:update-release-properties] updates the `release.properties` file
with the release and development versions as determined by Revapi according to the http://semver.org[semver] rules.

The full description of all available goals is located link:{attachmentsdir}/plugin-info.html[here].


== Usage

Revapi maven plugin is very simple to use. Just define what revapi extensions should be used, what artifacts to
compare and off you go. See the <<Examples,examples>> section, below.

In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please feel free to contact the
link:{attachmentsdir}/mail-lists.html[user mailing list]. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
the link:{attachmentsdir}/mail-lists.html[mail archive].

If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
link:{attachmentsdir}/issue-tracking.html[issue tracker]. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of
your concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
Of course, patches are most welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
link:{attachmentsdir}/source-repository.html[source repository] and will find supplementary information in the
http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html[guide to helping with Maven].

=== Examples

The list of extensions you want to use with Revapi is provided to it as plugin dependencies. Usually you will want to
check the API of your java archives, so this is the minimal configuration you need to provide to revapi (note that the
xref:revapi-basic-features::index.adoc[basic features] extension is implicitly present because without it Revapi
can do literally nothing).

[subs="attributes+,macros+"]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
      <artifactId>revapi-java</artifactId>
      <version>component:revapi-java[version]</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

== Specifying Versions To Check

By default, Revapi will automagically figure out the latest released version of your project and check the code that's
been built against it.

This is assumed to be the most common usecase and as such requires no additional configuration. But it always is not
exactly what you want.

=== Specific Old Version

You can choose to explicitly select the old version to check. This is useful in scenarios where you need tell
specifically the old version and Maven rules for determining the latest release does not pick the right one.

You can use one of the following configuration parameters of Revapi maven plugin:

* `oldArtifacts` - This can be used to precisely specify the GAV (or more GAVs) of the artifact(s) representing your old
version.
* `oldVersion` - Using this, Revapi will reuse the groupId, artifactId, type and classifier of your currently built
artifact and will use the specified version. I.e. using this, you can easily specify the older version of your artifact
to check against.

Both of these parameters have their command-line names, too. Please consult the `check` goal
link:{attachmentsdir}/check-mojo.html[docs] for details.

=== Specific New Version

This is not a very common usecase but you can also specify the new version of the API (i.e. something different than
what the Maven just built). Use `newArtifacts` or `newVersion` parameters with similar meaning to the `old` variants.

=== Leaving Out Pre-releases

Frequently, you will release alpha or beta versions before you release the final version of your project.
Maven will consider any non-snapshot release as the latest, but that's possibly not what you want to check against.

After you release a beta, you still want your project to be checked against the last final release, not against the
beta.

You could explicitly specify the `oldVersion` to be your last final release but the caveat of that is that you will
have to remember to change that after you release your new final release (so that your new final release becomes the
new baseline for the future development).

There is a simpler way though.

You can use the `versionFormat` link:{attachmentsdir}/check-mojo.html#versionFormat[configuration parameter] to specify how the
version string of the latest release must look like.

For example if you use "GA" as the suffix of your final releases and you released `1.0.GA`, `2.0.Alpha` and `2.0.Beta`,
you can configure Revapi maven plugin like this:

```xml
<configuration>
  <versionFormat>.*\.GA</versionFormat>
</configuration>
```

and Revapi will use the latest release that matches that regular expression (which would be `1.0.GA`) instead of the
latest release as reported by Maven (which would be `2.0.Beta`).

Note that the version format applies to both old and new versions and is only taken into account if the version string
is one of the Maven's special version specifiers - `RELEASE` or `LATEST` (`RELEASE` is the default value of `oldVersion`
configuration parameter, so the above configuration will take effect).


== How to Configure Revapi

The maven plugin itself is configured using the properties of the link:{attachmentsdir}/plugin-info.html[goals]. The configuration of
the API analysis is a matter of configuring different Revapi extensions that are to be run. This is done using the
`analysisConfiguration` element in the Maven plugin's configuration. This element contains the configuration of
the individual extensions in either XML or JSON.

=== Specifying The Analysis Configuration Using XML

==== Ignoring classes ====

As an example, let's configure the java extension to ignore the classes it finds missing from the API
rather than reporting them and also only include the archives with `com.acme` groupId in the analysis::

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.java>
        <missing-classes>
          <behavior>ignore</behavior>
        </missing-classes>
      </revapi.java>
      <revapi.filter>
        <archives>
          <include>
            <item>com\.acme:.*</item>
          </include>
        </archives>
      </revapi.filter>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
```

Each extension has a unique "extension id" which is used as the root tag for its configuration under the
`analysisConfiguration` tag. Under the extension configuration's root tag an XML representation of the configuration
as specified by the extension documentation (and JSON schema - yes, the XML is validated against a JSON schema ;) ).

==== Failing level ====

By default, `mvn revapi:check` fails if at least one potentially breaking change is found. To fail only for breaking changes, one has to set up `failSeverity` as follows.

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <failSeverity>breaking</failSeverity>
    ...
```


==== Multiple Configurations Per Extension

There can be multiple configurations for a single extension. Optionally, each extension configuration "instance" can
be assigned an ID such that it can be effectively merged (see below).

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="stdout">
        <output>out</output>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="custom-report">
        <output>${project.build.directory}/revapi-custom-report.xml</output>
        <template>${custom-report.template.location}</template>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
```

This configuration will cause the Revapi's text reporter (if is included as a dependency of the plugin) to output the
results of the analysis both to standard output and a custom file using a custom template.

==== Analysis Configuration And Maven Inheritance

Having the Revapi analysis configuration specified in XML enables Maven to apply its configuration inheritance logic
to Revapi analysis configuration, too.

Here is a couple of tips on how to make the Maven configuration inheritance work nice with Revapi analysis
configuration.

TIP: link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-help-plugin/effective-pom-mojo.html[`mvn help:effective-pom`],
link:https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Plugins[`combine.self` and `combine.children`] are your friends when inheriting
more complex analysis configurations.

==== One Configuration Per Extension

Parent POM:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.ignore>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.removed</code>
        </item>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.added</code>
        </item>
      </revapi.ignore>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
  ...
```

Child POM:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.ignore>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.nowFinal</code>
        </item>
      </revapi.ignore>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
  ...
```

Effective Child POM:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.ignore>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.nowFinal</code>
        </item>
      </revapi.ignore>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
  ...
```

Notice that `revapi.ignore` doesn't contain the ``item``s defined in the parent POM. That is the default Maven behavior.
To be able to inherit the configuration of the `revapi.ignore` extension from the parent POM, you have to specify
how to merge the `item`s in the child POM like so:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.ignore combine.children="append">
        <item>
          <code>java.class.nowFinal</code>
        </item>
      </revapi.ignore>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
  ...
```

After that, the effective child POM will indeed contain configuration combined from both parent and child:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.ignore>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.nowFinal</code>
        </item>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.removed</code>
        </item>
        <item>
          <code>java.class.added</code>
        </item>
      </revapi.ignore>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
  ...
```

==== Multiple Configurations Per Extension

As mentioned in the previous chapters, revapi supports multiple configurations per extension. This gets a little bit
complicated in conjunction with inheritance. Let's see an example.

Parent POM

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="stdout">
        <output>out</output>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="custom-report">
        <output>${project.build.directory}/revapi-custom-report.xml</output>
        <template>${custom-report.template.location}</template>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
```

Child POM

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="stdout">
        <output>err</output>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
```

I.e. the child POM wants to reconfigure the "stdout" configuration of revapi text reporter to report to standard error
output instead of the standard output.

If we inspect the effective child POM, we'll see this though:

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="stdout">
        <output>err</output>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
```

I.e. the configuration for the custom output is lost in the child POM (again, this is standard Maven behavior. These are
just examples to save you from ripping your hair out unnecessarily ;) ). To also inherit the other reporter
configuration, you have to mention it like this in the child POM

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="stdout">
        <output>err</output>
      </revapi.reporter.text>
      <revapi.reporter.text id="custom-report"/>
    </analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
```

Now the effective child POM contains the custom report configuration as well as the modified stdout configuration.

=== Specifying The Analysis Configuration Using JSON

Revapi has been around for a little bit and over the time it has evolved. Originally (up until Revapi API 0.8.0),
each extension was instantiated exactly once and therefore also configured exactly once. Since Revapi API 0.8.0,
supported by Revapi Maven plugin 0.9.0, there can be multiple configurations for each extension (and the extension
can be therefore instantiated multiple times). This brings the ability to e.g. have 2 differently configured text
reporter instances, each generating a different kind of output. Unfortunately, this complicates the configuration,
because it is no longer possible to have a single "configuration tree" where extensions would read their configurations
from their declared locations.

Therefore, since Revapi API 0.8.0 there is a new kind of JSON format for configuration (which in turn also enables
maven plugin to support XML configuration btw). To ease the migration to the new versions, the old configuration format
is still supported (but mixing the two formats can lead to unresolvable situations, see the
<<Multi-file Configuration>> section for more details).

==== The JSON Configuration Format

As explained above, each extension can be configured multiple times. To support this in JSON, the JSON configuration
looks like this:

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.reporter.text",
    "id": "optional-id",
    "configuration": {
      ... the actual configuration of the extension according to its schema ...
    }
  },
  {
    "extension": "revapi.reporter.text",
    "configuration": {
      ...
    }
  },
  {
    "extension": "revapi.ignore",
    "configuration": {
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

The configuration object is a list. The members of the list are individual configurations for the extensions.
The extension being configured is specified by the `extension` key and the configuration (conforming to the schema
specified by the extension) is present under the `configuration` key.

The optional `id` key is useful if there are multiple configuration sources (see
<<Multi-file Configuration,multi file configuration>> for example) as it affects how the configurations from the
different sources are merged together.

==== The Legacy JSON Configuration Format

WARNING: This describes the obsolete JSON configuration format that cannot handle multiple configurations per extension.
If you still use it, rest assured that it is still supported (with the exception of certain scenarios during merging
of multiple configuration sources) but you are encouraged to start using the new configuration format.

The JSON data contains the configuration of all the extensions. Each of the extensions declares a "root" in the JSON
data from which it reads its configuration (for example, ignoring specific problems found during the analysis can be
done using the `IgnoreDifferenceTransform` extension from the xref:revapi-basic-features::index.adoc[basic
features] under the root `revapi.ignore`).

So, without further ado, let's configure the java extension to report the classes it finds missing from the API
rather than failing the analysis upon encountering them and also only include the archives with `com.acme` groupId in
the analysis:

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <analysisConfiguration><![CDATA[
      {
        "revapi": {
          "java": {
            "missing-classes": {
              "behavior": "report"
            }
          },
          "filter": {
            "archives": {
              "include": ["com\\.acme:.*"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]]></analysisConfiguration>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
```

The configuration options of the various extensions can be found in their respective docs:
xref:revapi-basic-features::index.adoc[basic features documentation], xref:revapi-java::index.adoc[java
extension documentation].


== Evolving The Library Using Semver Rules

By default Revapi will report all API changes of configured severity (by default "potentiallyBreaking") and the maven
plugin will break the build if such differences are found since the last released version.

One then has to somehow "persuade" the plugin to let the build pass again. One way of doing it is to use the
xref:revapi-basic-features::ignore.adoc[ignore extension] and list all the changes and provide them
with a "justification" for why such change happened.

This is very rigorous but also laborious approach that isn't always worth the effort - especially in the early stages
of development. Also one can argue that any change made to the codebase is intentional and therefore specifically
listing it somewhere in a file that would justify such change to a tool is superfluous. On the other such strict
policy might be required for some critical libraries that require high level of stability and any change should be
vetted and approved.

There is also another way though. One can use the combination of the
xref:revapi-basic-features::semver-ignore.adoc[semver-ignore extension] and the
<<Updating Version In `pom.xml`,update-versions goal>> to (semi-)automatically increase the version of the library
even during the development such that its version corresponds to the API changes it contains since the last released
version. No other action like listing the and justifying the changes is necessary in this case.

For that you need to configure Revapi maven plugin to use and enable the
xref:revapi-basic-features::semver-ignore.adoc[semver-ignore extension]:

```xml
<build>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
        <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
            <analysisConfiguration><![CDATA[
                {
                  "revapi": {
                    "semver": {
                      "ignore": {
                        "enabled": true
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
            ]]></analysisConfiguration>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
</build>
```

Then, when you try to build your project, revapi might find a change that is incompatible with the current version
increase (like an API breaking change when you only increased a micro version since the last release) and fail your
build. At that moment, it is enough to invoke:

```
mvn revapi:update-versions
```

and the version will be updated to reflect the API changes made. When you build the project again, the build should
pass.

NOTE: You can even embed the `update-versions` goal in your regular build and have the versions increase automagically
(at the cost of having to run the build twice when an incompatible change is made).


== Multi-file Configuration

Sometimes it can be handy to split the configuration of Revapi analysis in separate files - this can be done for various
reasons - you might want to keep the config of different extensions separate or you want to compose the config from
various contributing locations, etc.

For Revapi, this can be achieved by using the `analysisConfigurationFiles` configuration element instead of (or in
addition to) the `analysisConfiguration` element which provides the in-POM way of configuring Revapi.

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{page-component-version}</version>
    ...
    <configuration>
        <analysisConfigurationFiles>
            <file>${project.basedir}/config/filter.json</file>
            <file>${project.basedir}/config/ignore.xml</file>
        </analysisConfigurationFiles>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

Each of the configuration files (e.g. `filter.json` and `ignore.xml` in the above example) is a JSON or XML document
with the configuration. The maven plugin then merges the files together (in an unspecified order) and uses the
result as the final configuration for the analysis.

=== Using Configuration Defined In Other Modules

It is possible to define a JAR artifact that contains "common" configuration of the Revapi analysis shared by many
modules. To reference it, simply add the artifact as a dependency of the revapi maven plugin and reference
the configuration file inside that artifact like:

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{page-component-version}</version>
    <dependencies>
      ...
      <dependency>
        <groupId>my.group.id</groupId>
        <artifactId>artifact-with-common-config</artifact>
        <version>...</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    <configuration>
        <analysisConfigurationFiles>
          <configurationFile>
            <resource>path/to/the/config/file/in/the/shared/artifact</resource>
          </configurationFile>
          ...
        </analysisConfigurationFiles>
        ...
    </configuration>
    ...
</plugin>
```

=== Merging Configuration From Multiple Files

When the analysis configuration is split amongst several files, it needs to be merged together before it is applied to
the Revapi extensions. This process is slightly complex with the ability for a single extension to be configured
multiple times but in the end is somewhat similar to the way Maven merges the executions of a plugin - as long as the
executions are defined once in the effective POM, they don't need to be assigned IDs. If there are multiple executions
and you override them in child POMs, they need to have the IDs assigned so that it is clear what executions in child POM
need to be merged with what executions in the parent POM.

In Revapi, too, an extension configuration can optionally have an ID. In JSON this is expressed like this:

```javascript
...
    {
      "extension": "my.extension",
      "id": "id",
      "configuration": ...
    }
...
```

and in XML like so:

```xml
...
    <my.extension id="myid">
      ...
    </my.extension>
...
```

When merging configurations without an explicit ID, everything works as long as there is at most a single configuration
for each extension in each configuration file to be merged. As soon as there is more than one configuration for some
extension in one of the configuration files, you need to assign IDs to the configurations of that extension so that it
is clear what configs should be merged with what.

=== Custom Root Element of Configuration

It might sometimes be useful to be able to only use a part of a JSON document as configuration for Revapi. This might be
because the same file might be used for holding other data, too, or because the file(s) contain(s) multiple
Revapi configurations. Note that the custom root is only applicable to configuration files, not the in-POM
configuration.

The below example illustrates the usage of the custom configuration root.

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{page-component-version}</version>
    ...
    <configuration>
        <analysisConfigurationFiles>
            <file>${project.basedir}/config/filter.json</file>
            <file>${project.basedir}/config/ignore.json</file>
            <file>
              <path>${project.basedir}/config/json-data-for-many-things.json</path>
              <roots>
                <root>configuration/revapi</root>
              </roots>
            </file>
            <file>
              <path>${project.basedir}/config/xml-data-for-many-things.xml</path>
              <roots>
                <root>configuration/revapi</root>
              </roots>
            </file>
        </analysisConfigurationFiles>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

The above would read the configuration from the `filter.json` and `ignore.json` files. In addition it would also read
the configuration from the `json-data-for-many-things.json` and `xml-data-for-many-things.xml` files but would only
consider the data from the "configuration/revapi" subpath in those file. E.g. if the files looked like:

```javascript
{
  "itest-setup": {...},
  "configuration": {
    "our-custom-tool": {
    },
    "revapi": {
      ... HERE WE ARE ...
    }
  }
}
```

```xml
<configuration>
  <ci>...</ci>
  <revapi>
     ... HERE WE ARE ...
  </revapi>
</configuration>
```

The Revapi configurations would only be read from the "... HERE WE ARE ..." part of the documents.

Revapi itself uses this approach to track the changes made to its API across the versions using a single file. Each
Revapi module can have a "api-changes.json" file in its base directory. The contents of this file follow this pattern:

```javascript
{
  "version1": {
    "revapi": {
      "ignore": [
        ...
      ]
    }
  },
  "version2": {
    "revapi": {
      "ignore": [
        ...
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

I.e. in that file, the root elements are the released versions of revapi and under them there are configurations for
revapi for the particular version to pass the build. Usually, this is just a list of ignored API changes - i.e. the
API changes made in that release that are to be purposefully ignored by the tool so that the build passes. To make
this work, revapi build contains this profile:

```xml
<profile>
    <id>api-check</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>

    <build>

== Reporting With Revapi

=== Report Per Module

NOTE: Goal details page: link:{attachmentsdir}/report-mojo.html[here]

The Revapi Maven plugin offers the possibility to create simple reports of the API changes found in the analysis. The
link:{attachmentsdir}/report-mojo.html[report goal] offers the same configuration properties as the analysis itself. Just include
the following snippet in `reporting/plugins` of your POM:

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{page-component-version}</version>
    <reportSets>
        <reportSet>
            <reports>
                <report>report</report>
            </reports>
        </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
    ...
</plugin>
```

The report can be configured in a very much the same way as the build-time API check and provides virtually the same
configuration properties.

=== Aggregate Report

NOTE: Goal details page: link:{attachmentsdir}/report-aggregate-mojo.html[here]

For POM-packaged modules, one can create an aggregate report consisting of the individual reports of the modules that
are (indirectly) referenced by the POM module. Again this can be configured the same way the rest of the Revapi goals.
Please consult the details page of the goal for the individual configuration properties.

[subs=+attributes]
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{page-component-version}</version>
    <reportSets>
        <reportSet>
            <reports>
                <report>report-aggregate</report>
            </reports>
        </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
    ...
</plugin>
```


== Comparing Specific Artifacts

By default Revapi checks the currently built artifact against the latest released version of it. This actually is
equivalent to running the maven plugin with the following set up:

[subs=+macros]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <oldArtifacts>
        <artifact>${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:RELEASE</artifact>
    </oldArtifacts>
    <newArtifacts>
        <artifact>${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}</artifact>
    </newArtifacts>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
```

I.e. the `oldArtifacts` are set up to include the current project with the `RELEASE` version, which is Maven's way of
saying "this project in the latest released version". The `newArtifacts` specifies the currently built project.

The above example implies a couple of things:

* you can include more than one artifact to be included in the analysis
* you don't have to specify the "supplementary archives" - the dependencies of the artifacts are automatically
obtained from Maven and used during the analysis so that the complete classpath is used
* you're not constrained to check the artifacts of the current project - in fact you could have a separate "check"
module that would perform API checks completely separately from other modules in the project.


== Updating Version In `pom.xml`

NOTE: Goal details page: link:{attachmentsdir}/update-versions-mojo.html[here]

Revapi needs two artifacts to compare against each other to determine the API differences and therefore the required
version changes. By default the new artifact is the project being built so the artifacts need to be actually produced
prior to running revapi. This is usually done in the `package` phase, which is therefore run prior to any Revapi goal.

When updating the version, the plugin takes into consideration the configuration of Revapi as declared in the
`pom.xml` but does not use certain extensions that would make some of the differences disappear (like
the xref:revapi-basic-features::semver-ignore.adoc[semver-ignore extension]). This list of extensions is
configurable using the `disallowedExtensions` configuration property, see the goal's
link:{attachmentsdir}/update-versions-mojo.html[detail page] for further info.

For a single-module project, updating the versions is very simple:

```
mvn revapi:update-versions
```

The `version` in `pom.xml` will be updated according to the API changes and the semantic versioning rules.

For multi-module project, one has more options. If each of the modules in the project is independently versioned,
then the invocation is the same as for the single-module project, but if you version the child modules uniformly with
the parent (i.e. you set `autoVersionSubmodules` to `true` when releasing using the maven release plugin), you should
set the `singleVersionForAllModules` of revapi to `true`, too. Generally, `autoVersionSubmodules` and
`singleVersionForAllModules` should be set to the same value.

```
mvn revapi:update-versions -Drevapi.singleVersionForAllModules=true
```

This will check the API differences in all the child modules and will determine the version of the whole based on the
"biggest" change. I.e. if one child module breaks the API then the major version will be increased in all modules even
though the rest of the child modules might not have changed at all.


== Updating Versions In `release.properties`

NOTE: Goal details page: link:{attachmentsdir}/update-release-properties-mojo.html[here]

This works identically to the <<Updating Version In `pom.xml`,update versions goal>> but instead of updating the version
directly in the `pom.xml` files, it creates or updates the `release.properties` file. This will then be read by the
maven release plugin during the release process.

Thus, running:

```
mvn revapi:update-release-properties && mvn release:prepare
```

will automatically set the release and development versions for you according to the http://semver.org[semver]
versioning rules.
